**Project Summary: Linux Terminal Operations**
Date: January 15, 2026
System: Linux / Ubuntu
Objective: Demonstrate proficiency in basic file manipulation, user permissions, and system performance monitoring.

1. Directory & File Management
In this phase, I practiced creating, navigating, and deleting files and directories.
•	Commands used: mkdir, cd, touch, ls, rm.
•	Key Actions:
o	Created a directory named elevate.
o	Generated dummy files (dev1.txt, dev2.txt).
o	Performed cleanup by recursively removing directories using rm -Rf.
2. Permissions & Ownership
I demonstrated how to modify file security settings and change user ownership.
•	Commands used: chmod, chown, useradd.
•	Key Actions:
o	User Creation: Added a new user named rock.
o	Permissions: Changed test.txt permissions to 655 (Read/Write for owner, Read/Execute for group and others).
o	Ownership: Successfully transferred file ownership to the rock user and group.
Note: I encountered a small typo in command #29 (chwon), which was immediately corrected in command #30 (chown).
3. Use vi & cat command for editing and reading file.
4. System Monitoring
I utilized several Linux utilities to check system health and resource usage.
Command	Purpose
top / htop	Real-time process monitoring and CPU usage.
df -h	Checked disk space in human-readable format.
free -m	Checked available and used memory (RAM) in Megabytes.
